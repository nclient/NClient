NClient is an automatic, type-safe .NET HTTP client that can call web API methods using annotated interfaces.
The main difference between NClient and its analogues is that NClient lets you annotate ASP.NET controllers via interfaces and then use these interfaces to create clients.
This allows you get rid of unwanted dependencies on a client side and to reuse an API description in clients without boilerplate code. 

```C#
// WebService.dll:
public class WeatherController : ControllerBase, IWeatherFacade {
    public Task<Weather> GetAsync(string city, DateTime date) => ...;
}

// WebService.Facade.dll:
[HttpFacade, Path("api/[facade]")] 
public interface IWeatherFacade {
    [GetMethod("{city}")] 
    Task<Weather> GetAsync([RouteParam] string city, [QueryParam] DateTime date);
}

// Client.dll:
IWeatherFacade weatherFacade = NClientGallery.Clients.GetRest()
    .For<IWeatherFacade>(host: "http://localhost:5000")
    .WithSafeResilience(maxRetries: 3)
    .Build();
Weather todaysWeather = await weatherFacade.GetAsync(city: "Chelyabinsk", date: DateTime.Today);
```

<a name="why" />  

## üöÄ Why use NClient?
Creating clients for web services can be quite a challenge because, in addition to data transfer, you need to implement query building, serialization, retry policies, mapping, error handling, and logging ‚Äî not to mention the maintenance that comes with each update of your APIs. What if you could create clients with a fraction of the effort? This is exactly what NClient aims to achieve by allowing you to create clients declaratively.

By the way, you can [contribute](#contributing) to the NClient, not just use it :smiley:

<a name="advantages" />

## üí™ Advantages of NClient
- **Integration with ASP.NET:** Clients are available for all controllers out of the box.

## üèÅ How to install?
The easiest way is to install [NClient package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NClient) using Nuget:
```
dotnet add package NClient
```

<a name="requirements" />

## üöß Requirements
Use of the NClient library requires .NET Standard 2.0 or higher. The NClient controllers can be used with ASP.NET Core and .NET Core 3.1 target or higher.

<a name="usage" />  

## üë©üèº‚Äçüíª How to use?
First, you have to create an interface describing the available endpoints and input/output data of a service via annotations. After that, you can select the required type of client in `NClientGallery` and then set additional settings for it if necessary.

<a name="usage-non-aspnet" />

### Usage with third-party service
If you want to send requests to a third-party service, you should create an interface that describes the service you want to make requests to. Follow the steps below:
#### Step 1: Install `NClient` in the client project
```
dotnet add package NClient
```
#### Step 2: Install `dotnet-nclient` tool
```
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-nclient
```
#### Step 3: Generate the interface describing the API of the web service
```
dotnet nclient generate facade --api path/to/product-service-swagger.json --output MyProject/Client.cs
```
This command will generate an interface for the API using the OpenAPI (Swagger) specification:
```C#
[Path("api")]
public interface IProductServiceClient
{
    [PostMethod("products")]
    Task<Product> CreateAsync(Product product);
    
    [GetMethod("products/{id}")]
    Task<Product> GetAsync([RouteParam] int id);
}
```
If necessary, the interface can be changed. It is easy to do this because interface annotation is very similar to the annotation of controllers in ASP.NET. The `PathAttribute` defines the base path for all interface methods. The `PostMethodAttribute` specifies the type of HTTP method and the path to the endpoint.
Moreover, implicit annotations work as in ASP.NET controllers; for example, the `BodyParamAttribute` attribute will be implicitly set to the product parameter in the CreateAsync method. And certainly, route templates are also supported.
Read about all the features in the [Annotation](https://github.com/nclient/NClient/wiki/Annotation) and [Routing](https://github.com/nclient/NClient/wiki/Routing) sections.
#### Step 4: Create the client
```C#
IProductServiceClient client = NClientGallery.Clients.GetRest()
    .For<IProductServiceClient>(host: "http://localhost:8080")
    .Build();
```
The `GetRest` method creates a REST client with `System.Text.Json` serialization and without a resilience policy.
#### Step 5 (optional): Configure the client
```C#
IProductServiceClient client = NClientGallery.Clients.GetRest()
    .For<IProductServiceClient>(host: "http://localhost:8080")
    .WithNewtonsoftJsonSerialization()
    .WithResilience(x => x
        .ForMethod(client => (Func<Product, Task<Product>>) client.CreateAsync)
        .Use(maxRetries: 2, attempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2, attempt))))
    ...
    .Build();
```
After calling the `For` method, you can configure the client as needed. For example, you can replace the serializer with `Newtonsoft.Json`, add a retry policy, and so on. See the full [documentation](https://github.com/nclient/NClient/wiki).
#### Step 6: Send an http request
```C#
// Equivalent to the following request: 
// curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" --data "{ id: 1 }" http://localhost:8080/api/products
Product product = await client.CreateAsync(new Product(name: "MyProduct"));
```

### Usage with ASP.NET Core
If you want to generate a client for your ASP.NET web service, you need to extract an interface for your controller and annotate it with NClient attributes. These attributes are very similar to those used for ASP.NET controllers. Follow the steps below:
#### Step 1: Install `NClient.AspNetCore` package on server-side
```
dotnet add package NClient.AspNetCore
```
#### Step 2: Create the controller
```C#
public class WeatherForecastController : ControllerBase
{
    public async Task<WeatherForecast> GetAsync(DateTime date) =>
        new WeatherForecast(date: date, temperatureC: -25);
}
```
Do not annotate your controller with ASP.NET attributes that may cause semantic conflicts with the NClient attributes you intend to use. 
However, other attributes (including your own) can be used without restrictions.
#### Step 3: Extract the interface for your controller and annotate it with NClient attributes
```C#
[HttpFacade, Path("[controller]")]                                // equivalent to [ApiController, Route("[controller]")]
public interface IWeatherForecastController
{
    [GetMethod]                                                   // equivalent to [HttpGet]
    Task<WeatherForecast> GetAsync([QueryParam] DateTime date);   // equivalent to [FromQuery]
}

public class WeatherForecastController : ControllerBase, IWeatherForecastController { ... }
```
The annotation in the interface instead of the controller allows you to place the interface in a separate assembly. 
Consequently, the client using this interface doesn't depend on the ASP.NET application.
#### Step 4 (optional): Create the interface for the client
```C#
public interface IWeatherForecastClient : IWeatherForecastController { }
```
You should do it if you want your client type not to contain "Controller" in the name or if you want to override some methods for the client (see `OverrideAttribute` in [Annotation](https://github.com/nclient/NClient/wiki/Annotation#override) section). 
There is no need to duplicate interface attributes, as they are inherited.
#### Step 5: Add NClient controllers to ServiceCollection in Startup.cs
```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...
    services.AddNClientControllers();
}
```
The `AddNClientControllers` method can be used in combination with the `AddControllers` method. This allows you to use standard ASP.NET controllers together with NClient controllers in the same application.
#### Step 6: Install `NClient` package on client-side
```
dotnet add package NClient
```
#### Step 7: Create the client
```C#
IWeatherForecastController client = NClientGallery.Clients.GetRest()
    .For<IWeatherForecastController>(host: "http://localhost:8080")
    .Build();
```
If you decide to follow the 4th step, use the `IWeatherForecastClient` interface instead of `IWeatherForecastController`.
#### Step 8: Send an http request
```C#
// Equivalent to the following request: 
// curl -X GET -H "Content-type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/WeatherForecast?date=2021-03-13T00:15Z
WeatherForecast forecast = await client.GetAsync(DateTime.Now);
```
